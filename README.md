# Proposed Methods

## Augmentation for minority
### Method 1 - using a bounding box or polygon segmentation

### Method 2 - image to patch level

## dataloader.py & augmentation.py
- Implementation of augmentation for minority co-occurrence pair(k-pair) from dataset
- Augmentation Method 2(patch-level; similar as Cutmix) 

## Dataset Overview
- Train a model on MS-COCO 2017 train/val dataset
- Test a trained model using MS-COCO 2017 test dataset

- To train a model, we use Pascal-VOC 2012 trainval dataset
- To test a model, we use Pascal-VOC 2007 test dataset

## Model Setting
- We leverage Resnet-18, Resnet-50, Resnet-101 to test our augmentation method.
- Two major options for model, which are from scratch and from pre-trained weights on ImageNet.
- Our purpose of this augmentation is raising APs of minority class. It means that the model should be measured by classes-by-class AP tomeasure our augmentation method properly.

## How to Use
- If you want to apply the original setting, just use train.sh as a script
- To train model with another option, make your own script modifying the hyperparameters.
```
python3 main.py --lr 0.001 \
                --batch-size 64 \
                --scheduler cosine \
                --criterion soft \
                --device cuda:0 \
                --use-method \
                --save-dir runs/method
```
